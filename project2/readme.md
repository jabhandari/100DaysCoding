# 🚀 Day 2 of 100 Days of Code: Simple Calculator Application 🎉

Welcome to Day 2 of my **#100DaysOfCode** journey! Today, I built a **Simple Calculator Application** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and explore DOM manipulation for interactive functionality.

## 🌟 Features
- 🔢 **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division seamlessly.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes.
- 🖋️ **Decimal Support:** Handle calculations with decimal numbers.
- ⚙️ **Error Prevention:** Invalid operations are gracefully handled to ensure a smooth experience.

## 💡 What I Learned
- **DOM Manipulation:** Used JavaScript to dynamically update the calculator display and handle user inputs.
- **Reusability:** Designed modular and clean functions for better code maintenance.
- **CSS Styling:** Created a minimalist UI with visually appealing buttons and layout.
- **Debugging:** Fixed edge cases, such as replacing consecutive operators and restricting multiple decimal points.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
